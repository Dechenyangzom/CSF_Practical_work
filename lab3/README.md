# Fibonacci Number Implementations in Python

This repository contains various implementations and exercises that is related to Fibonacci numbers. The project indicates multiple programming techniques, including recursion, iteration, memoization, and generator functions, to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently.

## Features

- *Recursive Fibonacci Generator*: A simple implementation that calculates Fibonacci numbers using 
recursion.

- *Iterative Fibonacci Generator*: An efficient implementation that calculates Fibonacci numbers using an iterative approach.

- *Performance Comparison*: A method to measure and compare the execution time of recursive and iterative implementations.

- *Fibonacci Generator Function*: A generator function that yields Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.

- *Memoization for Recursive Fibonacci*: An optimized recursive implementation that uses memoization to reduce redundant calculations.

- *Exercises*:
  - Return a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.
  - Find the index of the first Fibonacci number that exceeds a given value.
  - Determine if a given number is a Fibonacci number.
  - Calculate the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers and observe its approach to the golden ratio.
