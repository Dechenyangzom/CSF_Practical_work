# Questions

# 1.What are the advantages and disadvantages of the recursive approach compared to the iterative approach?

# Recursive approach
# Advantages:
# >Simplicity & clarity: the recursive functions can be more intuitive and easier to read (e.g., factorial calculation, etc).
# >Less Code: the recursive solutions often require fewer lines of code.
# >Direct Modeling: the recursion directly models the fibonacci sequence formula F(n)= F(n-1)+F(n-2), which may be more intuitive.

# Disadvantages:
# >Stack overflow: Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth exceeds the systemâ€™s stack size.
# >Redundant calculations: In recursive implementations (like Fibonacci), the same values may be computed multiple times, leading to exponential time complexity.
# >High Memory usage:  Recursive calls consume memory on the call stack.

# Iterative approach
# Advantages:
# Performance: Have lower overhead and can be faster, especially for problems with a simple iterative structure.
# Memory efficiency: Consume less memory as they do not require additional stack space for function calls.

# Disadvantages:
# >Complexity: Can be more complex and harder to understand.
# >Less intuitive: the iterative approach may be less intuitive than the recursive one. 


# 2.How does memoization improve the performance of the recursive function? Are there any drawbacks?

# Memoization is an optimization technique used in recursive functions to store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
# Memoization significantly improves the performance of a recursive Fibonacci function by storing (or "memoizing") the results of previously computed values.

# Drawbacks of memoization:
# >Increased Space Complexity: Memoization requires additional space to store results, which can lead to higher memory usage.
# >Implementation Complexity: It can complicate the implementation, especially in cases where the recursive function has multiple parameters or requires careful management of the cache.


# 3.In what scenarios might you prefer to use a generator function over other implementations?

# >When dealing with large datasets where you want to avoid loading everything into memory.
# >When you need to produce an infinite series of values (e.g., Fibonacci numbers).
# >When you want to create a pipeline of operations where data is processed step-by-step.


# 4.How does the space complexity differ between these implementations?

# Recursive Functions:
# >Space Complexity: O(n) for the call stack in the worst case (where ( n ) is the depth of recursion).
# >With Memoization: O(n) for the call stack plus O(n) for the memoization cache, resulting in O(n) total space complexity.

# Iterative Functions:
# >Space Complexity: O(1) for simple iterations (using a fixed number of variables), or O(n) if an additional data structure (like a list) is used to store results.

# Generator Functions:
# >Space Complexity: O(1) since they yield one value at a time and do not store the entire sequence in memory.
